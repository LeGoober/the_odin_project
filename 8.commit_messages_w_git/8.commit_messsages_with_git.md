# Lecture 8 - Working on Git Commit Messages
Git commit messages are utilized in keeping orderly structure of the manner in which a project is being kept track of and managing the changes within the project.

>The importance of a good commit message lies on the fact that GitHub provides a track record of all the projects and commit history one software developer has.
 - commit message history functions as documentation in understanding how the changes are made by the developer and the why behind changes occur.
 - good commits are helpful in managing when coming back to a project you're working on and have stepped back a while ago.

>The constructs of a good commit message has the following elemnents:
 - [The Commit Subject]:
    having a brief summary of the changes made on the project allows the developer to describe the problem.

 - [The Body of the Commit]:
    the body is a more concise description of the changes made to the project. The manner in which we create commit messages that contain both the 'subject' and the 'body' is by ommiting the `-m` flag in the commit message.

 -[When to Commit a Change to the Project]:
    good commits are like snapshots of the code at the moment its been made, and is considered best practice to note them when meaningful changes are made in the code.

    by making commits when we are working on typos or bugs within our projects give us experience in developing a better feel for commit messages.
