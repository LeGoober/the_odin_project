		<h1>The Playground</h1>
		<p>
			This is just a refresher course on the 
			fundamentals of HTML.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			To display some of the things I've learnt
			thus far are:
		</p>
		<h2>Getting into Elements and Nesting</h2>
		<p>
			The process of nesting elements involves 
			understanding that any elements that live 
			inbetween the space of certain tags become
			<strong>children elements</strong> of those 
			tags.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Just like the text in bold above, I nested the 
			'strong' element within the paragrah element, so 
			it becomes a child element of the paragraph.
		</p>
		<p>
			So once we get into the styling, I'd can style all
			the child elements according to their nesting or 
			additional attributes like the:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The class Attribute</li>
			<li>The Identifier Attribute</li>
		</ul>
